# GDB Integration Test Plan

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic GDB Setup and Connection
- [ ] QEMU starts with GDB server enabled
- [ ] GDB successfully connects to QEMU
- [ ] Debug symbols are properly loaded
- [ ] Basic GDB commands work (continue, step, next)
- [ ] Breakpoints can be set and hit

### 2. MicroPython State Inspection
- [ ] Global variables are correctly displayed
- [ ] Local variables are accessible
- [ ] Python stack trace is accurate
- [ ] Different variable types are properly formatted:
  - [ ] Integers
  - [ ] Strings
  - [ ] Lists
  - [ ] Dictionaries
  - [ ] Custom objects

### 3. Custom GDB Commands
- [ ] mpy-bt shows Python backtrace
- [ ] mpy-locals displays current frame variables
- [ ] mpy-globals shows global variables
- [ ] mpy-stack displays Python stack contents

### 4. Exception Handling
- [ ] Breakpoint on exception works
- [ ] Exception information is properly displayed
- [ ] Stack trace shows exception path
- [ ] Local variables at exception point are accessible

### 5. Recursive Function Debugging
- [ ] Stack frames are properly tracked
- [ ] Local variables in each frame are accessible
- [ ] Return values are captured
- [ ] Frame navigation works

### 6. Memory and Performance
- [ ] Memory inspection works
- [ ] No memory leaks in GDB scripts
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
- [ ] Long debug sessions remain stable

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Debugging
1. Start debug session
2. Set breakpoint in main()
3. Run program
4. Inspect variables
5. Step through code
6. Continue execution

### Scenario 2: Exception Debugging
1. Run debug_test.py
2. Wait for ValueError exception
3. Inspect exception details
4. Check stack trace
5. View local variables

### Scenario 3: Recursive Function
1. Debug factorial function
2. Step through recursion
3. Check each stack frame
4. Verify variable values
5. Monitor return values

### Scenario 4: Memory Inspection
1. Examine MicroPython objects
2. Check memory layout
3. Verify pointer validity
4. Test memory commands
