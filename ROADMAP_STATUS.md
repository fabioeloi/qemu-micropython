# QEMU-MicroPython Roadmap Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of each roadmap item across releases. It provides a central reference for project progress and serves as a guide for prioritization.

## v1.1.0 Milestone: Debugging and QEMU Integration

| Feature | Status | Implemented In | Progress | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|-------|
| GDB integration for step-by-step debugging | In Progress | - | 25% | High | Initial integration started in v2025.03.01.8 with script improvements |
| Custom UART driver optimized for QEMU | Not Started | - | 0% | High | Planned for next sprint |
| Better semihosting integration | In Progress | v2025.03.01.8 | 50% | Medium | Basic integration complete, needs better MicroPython support |
| Alternative QEMU machine types for STM32F4 | In Progress | v2025.03.01.8 | 40% | Medium | Initial configuration with olimex-stm32-h405 complete |
| Comprehensive unit testing framework | Not Started | - | 0% | Medium | Planned after GDB integration |

## v1.2.0 Milestone: IoT and Simulation Capabilities

| Feature | Status | Implemented In | Progress | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Network simulation for IoT testing | Not Started | - | 0% | Medium | Depends on core QEMU integration completion |
| Virtual sensors simulation | Not Started | - | 0% | Medium | Research phase |
| State snapshots for efficient testing | Not Started | - | 0% | Low | Requires advanced QEMU configuration |
| OTA update mechanisms | Not Started | - | 0% | Low | Planned for later stage |

## v1.3.0 Milestone: Development Infrastructure

| Feature | Status | Implemented In | Progress | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|-------|
| CI/CD pipeline for automated testing | In Progress | Multiple releases | 30% | Medium | Basic GitHub Actions workflow implemented for releases |
| Automated testing in virtual environments | Not Started | - | 0% | Low | Depends on testing framework |
| Documentation improvements | In Progress | v2025.03.01.8 | 35% | High | README updated, more comprehensive docs needed |

## Timeline Adjustment

Based on current progress and priorities, the adjusted timeline is:

- **v1.1.0 (Complete)**: Target Q2 2025
- **v1.2.0 (Complete)**: Target Q4 2025
- **v1.3.0 (Complete)**: Target Q1 2026

## Current Focus Areas

1. Complete GDB integration for debugging (v1.1.0)
2. Implement custom UART driver for QEMU (v1.1.0)
3. Enhance documentation for current features (v1.3.0)
4. Improve unit testing capabilities (v1.1.0)
