### v1.1.0 Progress
Our progress on the v1.1.0 milestone has reached a significant milestone with the completion of the custom UART driver.

| Roadmap Item | Status Before | Status After | Progress |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| GDB integration | In Progress | In Progress | 25% |
| Custom UART driver | In Progress (80%) | Complete | 100% |
| Semihosting integration | In Progress | In Progress | 50% |
| Alternative QEMU machine types | In Progress | In Progress | 40% |
| Unit testing framework | Not Started | In Progress | 15% |

Overall milestone completion: ~60%

## Known Issues
- MicroPython bindings require compilation with QEMU_SIMULATION flag enabled
- Large data transfers may cause buffer overflow in certain configurations
- Real-time timing simulation is approximate and may not precisely match hardware timing

## Looking Ahead
For the next release, we plan to focus on:
- Extending the network simulation capabilities
- Improving the GDB integration for step-by-step debugging
- Enhancing the unit testing framework
- Documenting best practices for IoT application testing
