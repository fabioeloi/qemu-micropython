## Proposed Timeline

1. Complete remaining v1.1.0 tasks by mid-April 2025
   - Enhance exception state inspection and visualization
   - Test IDE integration
   - Finalize documentation
2. Release v1.1.0 final by end of April 2025
3. Begin v1.2.0 development in May 2025
   - Focus on network simulation expansion
   - Start virtual sensors implementation

## Current Progress

The v1.1.0 milestone is approximately 80% complete, with significant progress in:
- GDB integration (85% complete)
- Custom UART driver (100% complete)
- Testing framework (80% complete)
- Documentation (90% complete)

The remaining work focuses on enhancing exception handling visualization, IDE integration, and finalizing documentation.
