   - Update the GitHub release page
   - Announce the release to the community

2. **Set Up v1.2.0 Project Tracking**
   - Create GitHub issues for v1.2.0 features
   - Set up project board for tracking progress
   - Assign priorities and dependencies
   - Establish milestones for each phase

3. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Document lessons learned from v1.1.0
   - Identify reusable components from v1.1.0
   - Create architecture diagrams for v1.2.0 features
   - Conduct knowledge sharing sessions

4. **Begin v1.2.0 Implementation**
   - Start with Phase 1: Network Simulation
   - Build on the custom UART driver from v1.1.0

## Conclusion

The transition from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0 represents a significant step forward for the STM32 IoT Virtual Development Environment project. With the strong debugging foundation established in v1.1.0, the project is well-positioned to enhance its IoT and simulation capabilities in v1.2.0.

The v1.2.0 milestone will focus on creating a more realistic and comprehensive virtual environment for testing IoT applications, with features like network simulation, virtual sensors, state snapshots, and OTA update mechanisms. These features will enable developers to test their applications in a variety of scenarios without the need for physical hardware.

By following the transition plan outlined in this document, we can ensure a smooth and efficient transition between these two important milestones.
