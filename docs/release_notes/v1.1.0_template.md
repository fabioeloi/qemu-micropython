# Release Notes - v1.1.0 (Final)

## Overview

The v1.1.0 release marks the completion of the Debugging and QEMU Integration milestone for the STM32 IoT Virtual Development Environment. This release provides comprehensive debugging capabilities, enhanced QEMU integration, and improved testing frameworks for MicroPython development on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Major Features

### GDB Integration

- **Python-level Debugging**: Debug MicroPython applications at the Python level, with full access to Python variables, call stacks, and objects.
- **Custom GDB Commands**: Enhanced GDB with custom commands for MicroPython state inspection and navigation.
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling capabilities, including automatic exception breakpoints, exception state inspection, and exception visualization.
- **IDE Integration**: Integration with popular IDEs, including VSCode, PyCharm, and Eclipse, for enhanced debugging experience.

### Custom UART Driver

- **Enhanced Simulation**: Realistic UART simulation with configurable error rates, noise levels, and timing constraints.
- **Device-to-Device Communication**: Simulate communication between multiple UART devices for testing complex scenarios.
- **Python Bindings**: Access all UART simulation features from MicroPython code.
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing framework for UART communication, including network simulation and protocol testing.

### Semihosting Integration

- **Basic Support**: Implemented basic semihosting support for file I/O and console output.
- **MicroPython Integration**: Access semihosting features from MicroPython code.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for semihosting usage.

### QEMU Machine Types

- **olimex-stm32-h405**: Configured and optimized the olimex-stm32-h405 machine type for STM32F4 emulation.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for QEMU machine type configuration and limitations.

### Testing Framework

- **GDB Integration Tests**: Comprehensive tests for GDB integration, including exception handling and Python-level debugging.
- **UART Driver Tests**: Extensive tests for the custom UART driver, including error simulation and network testing.
- **IDE Integration Tests**: Tests for IDE integration, particularly VSCode integration.

## Documentation

- **GDB Debugging Guide**: Comprehensive guide for debugging MicroPython applications with GDB.
- **Exception Handling Documentation**: Detailed documentation for exception handling capabilities, including command reference, usage workflow, and examples.
- **UART Driver Documentation**: Complete documentation for the custom UART driver, including API reference and usage examples.
- **IDE Integration Documentation**: Guides for integrating with popular IDEs, including VSCode, PyCharm, and Eclipse.

## Beta Releases

The v1.1.0 milestone included several beta releases:

- **v1.1.0-beta.1**: Initial work on debugging capabilities
- **v1.1.0-beta.2**: Completed implementation of custom UART driver
- **v1.1.0-beta.3**: Enhanced UART testing capabilities
- **v1.1.0-beta.4**: GDB integration and Python debugging
- **v1.1.0-beta.5**: Enhanced exception handling documentation and testing

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with GDB connection to QEMU
- Addressed buffer overflow in UART driver
- Improved error handling in GDB scripts
- Fixed inconsistencies in version information

## Known Issues

- Some exception handling features may not work as expected in QEMU due to limitations in the emulation environment.
- The semihosting integration is basic and will be enhanced in future releases.
- Alternative QEMU machine types beyond olimex-stm32-h405 are not fully supported yet.

## Upgrading

To upgrade from a previous version:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Run `./scripts/build.sh` to build the firmware
3. Run `./scripts/run_qemu.sh` to test the firmware in QEMU
