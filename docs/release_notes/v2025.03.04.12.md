# Release Notes - v2025.03.04.12 (v1.1.0-beta.3)

## Overview

This release significantly enhances the custom UART driver with improved testing capabilities, network simulation features, and device-to-device communication. With these improvements, developers can now test complex IoT communication scenarios directly in QEMU without physical hardware.

## New Features

### Enhanced Custom UART Driver

- **New `custom_uart_transfer` Function**: Added functionality to transfer data between two UART devices, enabling multi-device simulations
- **Improved Buffer Management**: Fixed buffer index calculations to use consistent buffer size constants
- **Optimized Helper Functions**: Refined internal helper functions for more reliable buffer state checking

### Comprehensive Testing Framework

- **Network Simulation Test**: Added test script for simulating network conditions between UART devices:
  - Perfect conditions simulation
  - Bit noise simulation with configurable rates
  - Packet loss simulation with configurable rates
  - Combined error and noise simulation
  - Harsh condition simulation

- **Bridge Test**: Implemented specialized testing for direct device-to-device communication
  - Bidirectional data transfer
  - Debug callback validation
  - Comprehensive error checking

- **MicroPython Integration Test**: Added test script for validating MicroPython integration:
  - Python bindings for custom UART features
  - Testing in both simulation mode and QEMU environment
  - Comprehensive feature coverage

### Documentation Improvements

- **UART Driver Testing Document**: Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/UART_DRIVER_TESTING.md` covering:
  - Test components and their functions
  - Simulation capabilities (error, noise, timing)
  - Test scripts and usage instructions
  - QEMU integration details
  - MicroPython bindings examples
  - Future enhancement roadmap

## Performance Improvements

- **Optimized Data Transfer**: Enhanced buffering mechanism for more efficient data transfer
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error detection and reporting in simulation scenarios
- **More Realistic Timing Simulation**: Enhanced timing simulation to better represent real-world constraints

## Bug Fixes

- **Buffer Index Calculation**: Fixed inconsistent buffer size variables causing potential overflow
- **UART Transfer Logic**: Corrected logic in data transfer between devices
- **MicroPython Binding**: Fixed issues with Python method signatures and return values

## Project Structure Updates

- Added dedicated test scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Organized documentation in `docs/` directory
- Improved code organization with consistent naming conventions

## Known Issues

- GDB integration still requires additional work
- Timing simulation could be further improved for greater realism
- Some advanced UART features require additional testing

## Upgrading

No special steps required to upgrade from v2025.03.03.11 (v1.1.0-beta.2).
