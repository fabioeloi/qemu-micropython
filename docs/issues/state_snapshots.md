# State Snapshots for Efficient Testing

## Overview
Implement state snapshot capabilities for efficient testing of IoT applications in the virtual environment.

## Current Status
- Current completion: 0%
- Target version: v1.2.0
- Priority: Medium
- Dependencies: None

## Objectives

### 1. State Capture
- [ ] Design state capture architecture
- [ ] Implement memory state capture
- [ ] Add peripheral state capture
- [ ] Create CPU state capture
- [ ] Implement file system state capture

### 2. State Restoration
- [ ] Implement memory state restoration
- [ ] Add peripheral state restoration
- [ ] Create CPU state restoration
- [ ] Implement file system state restoration
- [ ] Add validation mechanisms for restored state

### 3. Snapshot Management
- [ ] Create snapshot storage format
- [ ] Implement differential snapshots
- [ ] Add snapshot compression
- [ ] Create snapshot metadata system
- [ ] Implement snapshot browsing and selection

### 4. Testing Integration
- [ ] Integrate with testing framework
- [ ] Create snapshot-based test scenarios
- [ ] Implement automatic snapshot creation at test points
- [ ] Add snapshot verification in tests
- [ ] Create snapshot-based regression testing

## Technical Details

### Implementation Requirements
1. Create a state snapshot framework
2. Implement state capture and restoration mechanisms
3. Create snapshot storage and management system
4. Integrate with QEMU and testing framework

### Testing Requirements
1. Create test scenarios for state capture and restoration
2. Implement tests for snapshot management
3. Add performance benchmarks for snapshot operations
4. Create reliability tests for state restoration

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully capture and restore complete system state
2. Support differential snapshots for efficient storage
3. Integrate seamlessly with testing framework
4. Provide reliable state restoration with validation

## Timeline
- Weeks 1-2: Architecture design and planning
- Weeks 3-6: State capture implementation
- Weeks 7-10: State restoration implementation
- Weeks 11-14: Snapshot management
- Weeks 15-16: Testing integration

## Notes
- Will require deep integration with QEMU
- Should be designed with performance in mind
- May require modifications to MicroPython for proper state capture
