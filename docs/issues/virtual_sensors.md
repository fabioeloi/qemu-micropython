## Technical Details

### Implementation Requirements
1. Create a virtual sensor framework
2. Implement sensor interface abstractions
3. Create realistic sensor behavior models
4. Integrate with QEMU peripheral emulation

### Testing Requirements
1. Create test scenarios for each sensor type
2. Implement tests for sensor interfaces
3. Add sensor behavior verification tests
4. Create performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully simulate at least 5 different sensor types
2. Support all common sensor interfaces (I2C, SPI, analog)
3. Generate realistic sensor data with configurable parameters
4. Provide easy-to-use API for sensor configuration and data access

## Timeline
- Weeks 1-2: Architecture design and planning
- Weeks 3-6: Sensor interface implementation
- Weeks 7-10: Sensor type implementation
- Weeks 11-14: Sensor behavior models
- Weeks 15-16: Testing and documentation

## Notes
- Should be designed with extensibility in mind for future sensor types
- Will require integration with QEMU peripheral emulation
- Should support both simple and complex sensor behavior models
