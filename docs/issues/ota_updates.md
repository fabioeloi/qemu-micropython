## Technical Details

### Implementation Requirements
1. Create an OTA update simulation framework
2. Implement update server and client components
3. Create firmware package format and management
4. Integrate with network simulation and state snapshots

### Testing Requirements
1. Create test scenarios for update processes
2. Implement tests for verification mechanisms
3. Add rollback and recovery tests
4. Create security feature tests

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully simulate complete OTA update process
2. Support verification and rollback mechanisms
3. Implement basic security features
4. Integrate with network simulation for realistic testing

## Timeline
- Weeks 1-2: Architecture design and planning
- Weeks 3-6: Update mechanism implementation
- Weeks 7-10: Verification and rollback implementation

## Notes
- Depends on network simulation for realistic update scenarios
- Should be designed with security in mind
- Will require integration with state snapshot system for rollback support
