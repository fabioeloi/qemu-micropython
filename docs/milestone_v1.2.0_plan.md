# v1.2.0 Milestone Plan: IoT and Simulation Capabilities

## Overview

The v1.2.0 milestone will focus on enhancing the IoT and simulation capabilities of the STM32 IoT Virtual Development Environment. Building on the strong debugging foundation established in v1.1.0, this milestone will add features for simulating IoT connectivity, virtual sensors, and more realistic testing scenarios.

## Key Features

### Network Simulation for IoT Testing (Priority: High)

- **Protocol-level Simulation**: Implement simulation of common IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP)
- **Network Conditions**: Simulate various network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations)
- **Multi-device Communication**: Enhance the existing UART-based communication to support multiple virtual devices
- **Network Debugging**: Add tools for debugging network communication

### Virtual Sensors Simulation (Priority: Medium)

- **Sensor Types**: Implement virtual sensors for temperature, humidity, motion, light, etc.
- **Sensor Behavior**: Create realistic sensor behavior models with configurable parameters
- **Sensor Interfaces**: Support common sensor interfaces (I2C, SPI, analog)
- **Sensor Fusion**: Implement sensor fusion algorithms for testing complex scenarios

### State Snapshots for Efficient Testing (Priority: Medium)

- **System State Capture**: Implement mechanisms to capture the system state at specific points
- **State Restoration**: Add functionality to restore the system to a previously captured state
- **Differential Snapshots**: Optimize storage by implementing differential snapshots
- **Integration with Testing Framework**: Integrate state snapshots with the testing framework

### OTA Update Mechanisms (Priority: Low)

- **Firmware Update Simulation**: Implement simulation of firmware update processes
- **Update Verification**: Add mechanisms for verifying successful updates
- **Rollback Support**: Implement rollback functionality for failed updates
- **Security Features**: Add security features for update authentication and verification
